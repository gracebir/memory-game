## Levels

The game features three levels of difficulty:

- **Easy**: 8 pairs of cards
- **Medium**: 12 pairs of cards
- **Hard**: 15 pairs of cards

## Game Rules

- Click on two cards to reveal their icons.
- If the icons match, the cards stay face-up. Otherwise, they flip back face-down.
- The goal is to match all pairs with the fewest moves and in the shortest time.

## Move Count

In this game, the move count is used as a measure of your performance. Fewer moves are better, as it indicates a better memory and faster completion time.
